# Information Retrieval Term Project

### Short News Text Clustering

This is the project I did for my Information Retrival and Text Mining Course

#### Project Summary

Conventional methods like Bag-of-word or TF-IDF representation are unsuitable for clustering short texts. For this purpose.
Two models, Google's Word2Vec and Convolutional Neural Networks, have been proposed
